# What is DappyKit?

**DappyKit** is an SDK for data decentralization and user ownership. It empowers users to create accounts, establish connections, manage public files and make peer-to-peer payments, all while maintaining control over their data across multiple applications.

It can be compared to Google Firebase, but it operates on Web3, allowing the creation of social connections and storage of files in uncensorable storages.

## What is the problem and how is it solved?

Every day new projects emerge for which the use of human social connections is important. Nevertheless, centralized platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Medium block people's accounts every day, without the possibility to recover social connections and data.

We're not planning to create a new social network. We'll make it so that social connections and user data can no longer be destroyed by centralized solutions. We'll ensure that when you switch between different applications, all your data and social connections will stay with you.

If you allow applications using our web SDK, all your public videos will become your personal "YouTube channel," all short notes will turn into "Twitter," long notes into "Medium," and photos into "Instagram." All your friends will be subscribers, followers, or readers.

For this, we aim to create a convenient web tool that allows people to:

-   Quickly and simply create ERC-4337 accounts

-   Store people's connections with each other in a smart contract without full third-party control

-   Verify the existence (if the person wants to) of Google, Twitter accounts, or a phone number through Soulbond Tokens support

-   Store their public data in a file system over IPFS, but store changes in files and directories structure in smart contracts

-   Use all of the above technologies without the person having to pay for transactions and without installing additional extensions, software, and so forth.

-   Have the ability to take responsibility for their data and social connections, using their own stack and finances. The developer or end user will always be able to switch to their own stack (own blockchain node, own IPFS server, self-payment of transactions)

-   Make payments between their social connections in various applications.

## Here's why DappyKit is primed for success:

1.  **Broad Compatibility:** The adaptability of DappyKit's SDK across various applications enhances our potential for user adoption success. Just a couple of successful integrations could lead to a significant increase in user base.

2.  **Seamless Integration:** We're committed to delivering a frictionless, Web2-like experience that combines the accessibility of traditional internet with the security and privacy of Web3.

3.  **Uncompromised Security:** Even while prioritizing optimal user experience, we do not compromise on security. We utilize the latest technologies to offer a secure platform.

4.  **Scalability for Growth:** DappyKit is designed for scalability. We're prepared to handle an escalating number of transactions as our user base grows, fueling a cycle of continual growth and adoption.

## Independence

DappyKit will operate on a freemium model. Basic usage, including a certain number of users and data, will be free. This approach will encourage adoption and lower the barrier to entry for new users.

However, as users' needs grow, for example in terms of data storage or the number of users they need to serve, we will offer paid plans. This tiered system will help sustain our project, fund the infrastructure, and enable us to continually provide free services to users who only require basic functionality.

Moreover, users or developers will always have the choice to switch to their own infrastructure if they want to have more control and are willing to handle their own costs. This flexibility ensures that DappyKit remains accessible and cost-effective for a wide range of users.

The company will be split into two entities; one will engage in non-profit open-source development, while the other will provide paid services for the utilization of the created solutions. However, we are not reserving the exclusivity of creating a commercial solution. We aim for the services to be of the highest quality, and hence, we intend to grow alongside other paid solutions.
